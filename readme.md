# Exploding Dots : A Javascript Experiment

This mini-project is to demonstrate an explosion effect:

- Custom Grid Sizes with coords
- DOM Manipulation
- Documented Unique Javascript Code

## A project to experiment with AI pathing algorithms.

I created this to experiment with how I could create a pathing aligorithm in Javascript.
While not an AI Pathing project yet, this is used as a stepping stone.

## Planned Updates

- Implement blocker points to navigate the explosion around
- Pathing Alogrithms
- Beautify the UI
